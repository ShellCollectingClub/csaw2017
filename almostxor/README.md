# AlmostXor
## Crypto 200

This was one of the few challenges we didn't solve during the competition. I'm
adding a [reference solution](solve.py) using z3 for related problems in the
future. This solution is an optimized version of a
[solution](https://gist.github.com/niklasb/dafa782255c1389392297edd398b742a#file-4_almost_xor-py)
provided by `niklasb` on IRC after the competition ended.
